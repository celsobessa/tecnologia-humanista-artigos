Um interessante artigo do CDT sobre transparência algorítmica

> We present findings in two parts: (1) guidelines about what information should be included in recommendation algorithm transparency reports, and how it should be presented; and (2) initial suggestions, in the form of prototypes, about more engaging and interactive ways of presenting such information to users, with an evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses.
