Apresentado por Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, da Anistia Internacional e Bill Marczak, do Citizen Lab (Universidade de Toronto), a palestra -- em inglês apenas -- apresenta uma interessante cronologia comentada de Pegasus e outros _exploits_ e _spywar_ utilizados pelo NSO Group.

> It is well understood that devices can be compromised by visiting malicious websites: in 2021, 24 of the 57 zero-day exploits reported to be used in the wild targeted browsers such as Chrome and WebKit. Less well understood is the world of remote 'zero-click' attacks, pushed to and executed automatically on devices anywhere in the world, via cloud messaging services such as iMessage and WhatsApp.
>
> While a few examples have come to light in recent years, there are still open questions about how common the attacks are, and strategies to detect them. Over the past two years, Amnesty International and Citizen Lab have forensically examined hundreds of devices, and have developed techniques to hunt for signs of compromise in phone logs.
