Simply Secure is an international organization that helps professionals design technologies that centralize and protect vulnerable populations.
His expertise spans privacy, security, transparency, ethical design, and more.

> Two years ago, Simply Secure asked our community for feedback about how our brand and name communicate our identity. The results of the survey were conclusive: We had outgrown our name, and our branding was too playful for our mission. We needed a new approach to reflect the serious work that we do.
>
> So we launched a co-design process—what we called a brand refresh.We organized a community identity committee to explore, grow, and design our new name and branding. Through interviews, workshops, and creative iterations, we landed on a direction that conveys the breadth of our current work, as well as our values, practice, and growth.

> Superbloom leverages design as a transformative practice to shift power in the tech ecosystem. We view design as an intervention opportunity to center people and their needs. We closely collaborate with others in the space to grow a community focused on shaping our collective online future.
