> The Antikythera program will generate new ideas from a direct interdisciplinary engagement with the past, present and potential futures of planetary computation.
>
> Antikythera’s Affiliate Researchers and practitioners develop new philosophy, research and speculative design. The program will host a five-month interdisciplinary and international design-research Studio in early 2023, where Studio Researchers will participate in intensive seminars, design workshops, and prototyping platforms. Studio outputs take form as technology and theory, cinema and code, platforms and policy that steer computation towards a more viable future.
> 
> Antikythera is directed by philosopher of technology Benjamin Bratton. Antikythera is developed and housed within the Berggruen Institute, and the Studio is supported by One Project.
